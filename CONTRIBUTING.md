Contributing to Ruby Attic

:gem: You are precious! :gem:  

There is not a single rule down there. Just ideas. Ideas change, so feel free to change the lines below.

## How to contribute

If you know a Ruby project needing help, please, help us help then!   
If you start maintaining a project listed here or noticed it's being maintained, please, tell us.  
You can either submit a pull request or open an issue.


## Guidelines

* Be polite
* Do some research.
* Add projects as `[Project](public githug/gitlab/whathever url)`
* Add one project per PR (I'll look then all)
